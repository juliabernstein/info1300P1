  <h2>About</h2>

  <p> I'm from Miami, so naturally I love the beach, but here in Ithaca I love to go on hikes with my friends. In my free time I play guitar, write songs, and journal (yes, I know, it's a glorified diary). </p>

  <p> Some of the coolest classes I've taken at Cornell are "Marx, Nietzsche, Freud," "History of Rock," and "Punk and Politics." </p>

  <p>I've also taken/am taking some amazing classes on iOS App Development and Web Design and Programming (where I learned to code this website).</p>
