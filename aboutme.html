        <p> Hi! I'm Julia. </p>

        <p>I'm from Miami, so naturally I love the beach, but here in Ithaca I love to go on hikes with my friends. In my free time I like to journal, play guitar, and write songs. </p>

        <p> Some of the most interesting classes I've taken here at Cornell are "Marx, Nietzsche, Freud," "History of Rock," and "Punk and Politics." I've also taken/am taking some amazing classes on iOS App Development and Web Design and Programming (where I learned to code this website).</p>

        <p>This year, I am the Social Chair of Delta Delta Delta sorority. I am also a member of Slope Media Group, Cornell Creatives, and Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC). </p>

        <p>At home, I play bass (and sometimes electric guitar) in a band called 10th Court. We play a lot of classic rock and 90s grunge! Personally, I am very into classic rock, alternative, and new wave.</p>
